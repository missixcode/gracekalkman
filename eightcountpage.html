Aimed at users who may feel too shy, too busy, or too financially constrained to attend a boxing gym, Eight Count offers a convenient and accessible way to learn boxing and get fit in the comfort of their own space. The app features instructional videos that guide users through boxing and fitness movements, making it easy to follow along at their own pace. Users can set personalized goals, whether it's to lose weight or build muscle, and progress through different skill levels as they watch and learn. The app is designed to keep users engaged and empowered, helping them achieve their fitness goals with confidence and energy.</p></div>

    <div class="summary-mission" data-reveal><p class="summary-title">My Contribution</p><p class="paragraph-text">As a UI/UX Designer for the Eight Count app, I helped shape the app’s user experience from start to finish. I began by creating a moodboard based on research to set the visual style and feel of the app. I then designed a pattern library to keep the design consistent throughout. I also created a sitemap to plan the app’s structure and user flow, followed by both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes to visualize how users would interact with the app. These steps helped ensure the app was visually appealing and easy to use.</p></div>

        <div data-reveal><p class="summary-title">Discover</p><p class="paragraph-text">During the research phase, I focused on understanding the visual and emotional energy I wanted the Eight Count brand to communicate. I created a moodboard centered around strong, bold colors—primarily red and black—to capture the intensity and power associated with boxing. Alongside this, I gathered a variety of black-and-white imagery that had a raw, gritty, and authentic vibe. These images reflected the feeling of focus, discipline, and determination that comes with boxing training. This process helped me define the visual language for the app—something that feels dynamic, empowering, and motivating, while still being accessible and approachable. The combination of red, black, and monochromatic tones became a key part of how the brand could stand out and appeal to people looking for a no-nonsense, at-home boxing experience.

I developed a detailed moodboard to refine the overall look and feel, keeping the energy and boldness of boxing at the core. Alongside this, I created a pattern library that included key design elements such as icons used throughout the app, along with the primary color palette of vibrant red and charcoal gray, paired with clean white text for high contrast and readability. This library served as a guide to maintain a cohesive visual identity across all screens and user interactions.</p></div>

            <div data-reveal><p class="summary-title">Sitemap/Wireframes</p><p class="paragraph-text">Once the visual direction was established, I moved on to organizing the app’s structure by creating a sitemap. This helped me map out the main sections and user flow, making sure the experience would be intuitive and easy to navigate. After finalizing the sitemap, I sketched out low-fidelity wireframes to plan the layout of each screen and how users would move through the app. The wireframes focused on simplicity and usability, ensuring that the instructional videos, progress tracking, and goal-setting features were easy to access without unnecessary distractions. This phase was essential in shaping a smooth and engaging user experience before moving into the high-fidelity design stage.</p></div>

          <div data-reveal><p class="summary-title">User Testing & Redesign</p><p class="paragraph-text">To evaluate the usability of the Eight Count app, I conducted user testing by asking participants a series of questions about how they would navigate through the app. I focused on key tasks such as finding the Workout and Demo pages, locating specific videos, and returning to the Homepage. Through this testing, I observed how users interacted with the app and identified areas that needed improvement. One of the main takeaways was that the Homepage felt too similar to the Workout page, making it unclear what made the Homepage unique or personalized. Based on this feedback, I reworked the Homepage layout and content to provide a more individual, welcoming experience for the user. Overall, the testing showed that the other pages were easy to navigate and successfully communicated the app's theme and purpose.</p></div>
